# mail-proj
A front-end website for an email client that makes API calls to send and receive emails.

I did this project mostly to practice using API calls (in JSON format) and JavaScript alongside with Django.

**This is one of the projects I did for 'CS50W - Web Programming with Python and JavaScript' course given by Harvard University on edX.**
